Introduction to Computers
The word computer was derived from the word compute, which apparently means to calculate. A computer is an electronic device used to perform high-end arithmetic operations at high speed.
A computer is also used as a data processor in order to process the data. It also stores data and retrieves it as and when desired.
Data processing is the process of manipulating data to get the desired output.
Data processing is classified into three categories:
* Input: Input is the process of capturing data
* Data Manipulation: Data Manipulation is processing the data to the desired output
* Output: is the desired result
Technically, a computer is used to perform various activities, but these activities revolve around input, manipulation, and output. Activities:
* Accepting Data
* Storing Data
* Processing Data
* Retrieving the Stored Data
* Printing results in the desired format
A computer is a combination of various devices integrated together to perform these activities.
Keyboard: 
* A keyboard is an input device that enables you to enter data into a computer.
* It is also known as a primary device to input text.
* It translates the pressed keys into a signal for the computer to understand.
Mouse:
* With the help of the mouse, we can take graphical inputs.
* A mouse is also an input device that controls the coordinates of a cursor and displays its movement on the monitor.
* It is a common input device for graphical interfaces.
